 * or as a a result of a timeout.
 * The callback function has the following signature:
 *   int fn(int fd, void* arg)
 * fd is the file descriptor where the input was received (for timeouts, this
 *    contains no information).
 * arg is an argument given when the callback was registered.
 * If the return value of the callback is < 0, it is treated as an unrecoverable
 * error, and the program is terminated.
